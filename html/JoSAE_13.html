<h2> LANDSAT data:
Prediction of County Crop Areas Using Survey and Satellite Data </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> The <code>landsat</code> data.frame is a compilation (by Battese
et al., 1988) of survey and satellite data. It consists of data on
segments (primary sampling unit; 1 segement =approx= 250 hectares) under
corn and soybeans for 12 counties in north-central Iowa; see Details,
below.
</p>
<p>The landsat data.frame was made available by Tobias Schoch with the R
package rsae. Since rsae was archived as of R 3.0.2, the data and this
description was copied from rsae 0.1-4 in the archives.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>landsat</code> data is a compilation (by Battese et al., 1988) of the LANDSAT satellite data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the 1978 June Enumerative Survey. 
</p>


<h4>Survey data</h4>

<p>The survey data on the areas under corn and soybeans (reported in hectares) in the 37 segments of the 12 counties (north-central Iowa) have been determined by USDA Statistical Reporting Service staff, who interviewed farm operators. A segment is about 250 hectares.
</p>



<h4>Satellite data</h4>

<p>For the LANDSAT satellite data, information is recorded as "pixels". The USDA has been engaged in research toward transforming satellite information into good estimates of crop areas at the individual pixel and segments level. A pixel is about 0.45 hectares. The satellite (LANDSAT) readings were obtained during August and September 1978.
</p>

<p>Data for more than one sample segment are available for several counties (i.e, unbalanced data). 
</p>
<p>Observations No. 33 has been flaged as outlier (cf., Battese et al. (1988, p. 28).
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data <code>landsat</code> is from Table 1 of Battese et al. (1988,
p. 29).
