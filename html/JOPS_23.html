<h2>Joys of P-Splines</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A package for working with and learning about P-splines. P-splines combine B-splines with discrete penalties to build a very flexible and effective smooth models. They can handle non-normal data in the style of generalized linear models.
</p>
<p>This package provides functions for constructing B-spline bases and penalty matrices. It solves the penalized likelihood equations efficiently.
</p>
<p>Several methods are provided to determine the values of penalty  parameters automatically, using cross-validation, AIC, mixed models or fast Bayesian algorithms.
</p>
<p>This package is a companion to the book by Eilers and Marx (2021). The book presents the underlying theory and contains many examples and the code <code>R</code> for each example is available on the website <a href="https://psplines.bitbucket.io">https://psplines.bitbucket.io</a>
