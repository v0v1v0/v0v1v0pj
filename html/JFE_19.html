<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Kelly criterion ratio (leverage or bet size) for a strategy.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">KellyRatio(R, Rf = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>R</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of returns to perform a mean over</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Rf</code></td>
<td>
<p>risk free rate, in same period as your returns</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Kelly Criterion was identified by Bell Labs scientist John Kelly, and
applied to blackjack and stock strategy sizing by Ed Thorpe.
</p>
<p>The Kelly ratio can be simply stated as: “bet size is the ratio of
edge over odds.” Mathematically, you are maximizing log-utility.  As such,
the Kelly criterion is equal to the expected excess return of the strategy
divided by the expected variance of the excess return, or
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">leverage=\frac{(\overline{R}_{s}-R_{f})}{StdDev(R)^{2}}</code>
</p>

<p>As a performance metric, the Kelly Ratio is calculated retrospectively on a
particular investment as a measure of the edge that investment has over the
risk free rate.  It may be use as a stack ranking method to compare
investments in a manner similar to the various ratios related to the Sharpe
ratio.
