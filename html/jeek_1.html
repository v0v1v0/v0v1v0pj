<h2>A Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for Integrating Additional Knowledge in
Learning Multiple Related Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an R implementation of a Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for
Integrating Additional Knowledge in Learning Multiple Related Sparse
Gaussian Graphical Models (JEEK).The JEEK algorithm can be used to fast
estimate multiple related precision matrices in a large-scale. For instance,
it can identify multiple gene networks from multi-context gene expression
datasets. By performing data-driven network inference from high-dimensional
and heterogenous data sets, this tool can help users effectively translate
aggregated data into knowledge that take the form of graphs among entities.
Please run demo(jeek) to learn the basic functions provided by this package.

<p> We consider
the problem of including additional knowledge in estimating sparse Gaussian
graphical models (sGGMs) from aggregated samples, arising often in
bioinformatics and neuroimaging applications. Previous joint sGGM estimators
either fail to use existing knowledge or cannot scale-up to many tasks
(large <code class="reqn">K</code>) under a high-dimensional (large <code class="reqn">p</code>) situation.  In this
paper, we propose a novel Joint Elementary Estimator incorporating
additional Knowledge (JEEK) to infer multiple related sparse Gaussian
Graphical models from large-scale heterogeneous data. Using domain knowledge
as weights, we design a novel hybrid norm as the minimization objective to
enforce the superposition of two weighted sparsity constraints, one on the
shared interactions and the other on the task-specific structural patterns.
This enables JEEK to elegantly consider various forms of existing knowledge
based on the domain at hand and avoid the need to design knowledge-specific
optimization. JEEK is solved through a fast and entry-wise parallelizable
solution that largely improves the computational efficiency of the
state-of-the-art <code class="reqn">O(p^5K^4)</code> to <code class="reqn">O(p^2K^4)</code>. We conduct a rigorous
statistical analysis showing that JEEK achieves the same convergence rate
<code class="reqn">O(\log(Kp)/n_{tot})</code> as the state-of-the-art estimators that are much
harder to compute. Empirically, on multiple synthetic datasets and one
real-world data from neuroscience, JEEK outperforms the speed of the
state-of-arts significantly while achieving the same level of prediction
accuracy.
