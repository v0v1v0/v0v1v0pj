<h2>Distance travelled by paper planes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A group from Queensland University of Technology conducted an experiment
where they recorded the distance flown by paper aeroplanes. The experimenters
used a sealed corridor at the University, and controlled the design of the
aeroplane, the weight of the paper from which each aeroplace was constructed,
and the angle of incidence at launch for each paper plane. The data and
further notes for this experiment can be found at
http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/planes.html.
