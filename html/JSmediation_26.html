<h2>Data set showing simple and moderated mediation analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set containing data from Experiment 3 from Ho, Kteiley,
and Chen (2017). In this experiment, the authors hypothesized that
presenting a text stating that Black-White biracials were discriminated
against would lead Black participants to associate Black-White biracials
more with their lower status parent group than their higher status parent
group, according to the rule of <em>hypodescent</em>. In this experiment, the
authors tested if this effect was mediated by the sense of linked fate
between discriminated Black-White biracials and Black participants.
</p>
<p>Note that this data set does not include the participants who were in the
discrimination control condition in the study conducted by Ho, Kteiley and
Chen (2017).
</p>
<p>See <code>mdt_simple</code> and <code>mdt_moderated</code> to conduct a
simple mediation or a moderated mediation analysis with this dataset.
