<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Histogram with Jackstrap Efficiency Indicators:  This function builds graphics with distributions of efficiency indicators
without outliers and complete sample. The outliers are defined by K-S Test.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hist_jack_ks(efficiency, model_hist_ks)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>efficiency</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the jackstrap object created by jackstrap function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model_hist_ks</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the desired graphic model. There are four kinds: 1- Density Histogram of efficiency indicator with
complete sample and without outliers by K-S test; 2 - Histogram of efficiency with complete sample and without outliers by K-S test;
3 - Histogram of efficiency without ouliers by K-S test; 4 - Histogram of efficiency with complete sample.</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Return the plot with efficiency indicators with complete sample and/or without outliers by combination leverage level and K-S test;
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> 
 
    #Build charts with efficiency indicators with jackstrap method and K-S test criterion
    hist_jack_ks(efficiency_ks, 1)
    hist_jack_ks(efficiency_ks, 2)
