<h2>Quality of life data following epilepsy drug treatment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The SANAD (Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs) study (Marson
et al., 2007) is a randomised control trial of standard and new
antiepileptic drugs, comparing effects on longer term clinical outcomes.
Quality of life (QoL) data were collected by mail at baseline, 3 months,
and at 1 and 2 years using validated measures. This data is a subset of the
trial for 544 patients randomised to one of 2 drugs: carbamazepine and
lamotrigine.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(epileptic.qol)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1853 observations on the following 9 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>id</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>patients identifier; in total there are 544 patients.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>with.time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>number of days between registration and the earlier
of treatment failure or study analysis time.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>trt</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels <code>CBZ</code> and <code>LTG</code> denoting
carbamazepine and lamotrigine, respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>with.status</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the reason for treatment failure. Coded as
<code>0=</code>censored; <code>1=</code>unacceptable adverse effects;
<code>2=</code>inadequate seizure control.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the time the quality of life measures were recorded
(days). The first measurement for each subject is the baseline measurement,
however there was variability between the time taken to return the
questionnaires; hence the reason this is non-zero. Similarly, the second,
third, and fourth follow-up times, which were scheduled for 3-months,
1-year, and 2-years, respectively, also had variability in completion
times.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>anxiety</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a continuous measure of anxiety, as defined according
to the NEWQOL (Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy Quality of Life) assessment. Higher
scores are indicative of worse QoL.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>depress</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a continuous measure of depression, as defined
according to the NEWQOL (Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy Quality of Life)
assessment. Higher scores are indicative of worse QoL.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>aep</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a continuous measure of the Liverpool Adverse Events
Profile (AEP), as defined according to the NEWQOL (Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy
Quality of Life) assessment. Higher scores are indicative of worse QoL.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>with.status2</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a binary indicator of composite treatment
failure (for any reason), coded <code>status2=1</code>, or right-censoring
<code>status2=0</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
