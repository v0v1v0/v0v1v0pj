<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When analysing your sample of articles from DfR, it might be helpful to have
some context about the journals in your sample. This function provides a
<code>tibble</code> with various information like the full name of the journal, the
short version of the name (sometimes referred to as <code>JCODE</code>), dates on where
the first
and last (available) issues were published, etc.
</p>
<p>The data on journals might change. Therefore this function provides two
sources of data: a cached version which gets updated with every release, and
the ability to pull the most recent version directly from DfR (this had to
be temporarily disabled.)
</p>
<p>The cached version was updated on 2020-04-03.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>tibble</code> with various information about journals.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># use the function without arguments to get a tibble from disk
jst_get_journal_overview()

## Not run: 
# download the most recent version from DfR
jst_get_journal_overview(most_recent = TRUE)

## End(Not run)
</code></pre>
