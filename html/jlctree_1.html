<h2>Fits Joint Latent Class Tree (JLCT) model.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fits Joint Latent Class Tree (JLCT) model. 
The main function of this package is <code>jlctree</code>.
</p>


<h4>Problem setup</h4>

<p>The dataset contains three types of variables about each subject:
the time-to-event, the longitudinal outcome, and additional covariates.
The goal is to jointly model the time-to-event by a survival model
and the longitudinal outcomes by a linear mixed-effects model,
and using the additional covariates.
The longitudinal outcomes consist of repeated measurements, thus 
are expected to be time-varying for a given subject. 
The additional covariates can be either time-invariant or time-varying.
Nevertheless, <code>jlctree</code> also allows data with time-invariant longitudinal outcome
and covariates.</p>



<h4>JLCT model</h4>

<p>This package implements the Joint Latent Class Tree (JLCT) modeling approach.
JLCT assumes that the population consists of homogeneous latent classes; 
within a latent class subjects follow the same survival and linear mixed-effects model,
but those differ from class to class.
In addition, JLCT assumes that conditioning on latent class membership, 
time-to-event and longitudinal outcomes are independent.
JLCT looks for a tree-based partitioning such that
within each estimated latent class defined by a terminal node,
the time-to-event and longitudinal responses display a lack of association.
Once the tree is constructed, JLCT assigns each observation to a latent class
(i.e. terminal node), and independently fits survival and linear mixed-effects models,
using the class membership information.</p>



<h4>Time-to-event data format</h4>

<p>The time-to-event data format required by <code>jlctree</code> depends on the 
time-varying nature of the variables to use:
if longitudinal outcome, or any of the covariates 
specified in <code>survival</code>, <code>classmb</code>, <code>fixef</code>, and <code>ranef</code>
is time-varying, then the time-to-event data must be in left-truncated right-censored (LTRC) format.
Otherwise, when longitudinal outcome and all of the covariates are time-invariant,
there should be only one observation per subject, and the time-to-event data 
can either be in LTRC format (when there exits subject-specific entry time) or in 
standard right-censored format.<br><br>
To construct time-to-event data in left-truncated right-censored format, consider using function
<code>tmerge</code> in <code>R</code> package <code>survival</code>. 
See the simulated <code>data_timevar</code> and <code>data_timeinv</code> for examples
of LTRC format and right-censored format respectively.
