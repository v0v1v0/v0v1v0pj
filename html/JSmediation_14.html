<h2>Dohle and Siegrist (2014, Exp 1) illustrating within-subject analysis
(wide-format)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set containing data from Dohle and Siegrist (2014)'s
Experiment 1 that can be used to conduct within-subject joint-significance
test. In this experiment, researchers are interested in the effect of name
complexity on willingness to buy a drug. The specific hypothesis is that
complex drug names are perceived as more hazardous, which makes someone
less likely to buy the drug. Researchers used a within-subject design.
</p>
<p>This data set is in a wide format, see <code>mdt_within_wide</code> to
conduct a within-participant mediation analysis with this dataset.
</p>
