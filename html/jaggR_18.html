<h2>Age estimation by root dentine translucency</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Root dentine translucency is, in humans, an age related physiological
feature. In the dentine of teeth in adult humans the
tubecular microstructures fill with a highly crystalline substance making
them become nearly invisible when looked at in normal light. This process
starts from the apical foramen in early adulthood, and progresses up the
tooth into advanced old age. Solheim (Lucy et al., 1996) collected data
on age, root dentine translucency for 71 maxillary second incisors from a
Norweigian population. The sex of each individual was also noted.
