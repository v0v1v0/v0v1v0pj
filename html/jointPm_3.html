<h2>Example data of flood levels and dependence strength between extreme rainfall and extreme storm tides from a coastal catchment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>"flood_table" is a matrix of flood levels with 100 different combinations of the rainfall and storm tides in terms of ARIs.<br>
"px" are ARIs of X variable associated with rows (rainfall).<br>
"py" are ARIs of Y variable associated with columns (storm tides).<br>
"pout" are ARIs for which flood levels are estimated with incorporation of joint dependence between extreme rainfall and storm tides.<br>
"prm" is the dependence parameter for the logistic model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(flood)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the low bounds of the marginal dsitributions, the lowest astronomical tide and no rainfall are used and ARI=0/AEP=1.
