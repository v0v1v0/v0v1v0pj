<h2>Create a summary statistic for Jaatha</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function creates summary statistics for Jaatha models. A summary
statistic consists primarily of a function that calculates the statistic
from the simulation results. Jaatha primarily supports Poisson distributed
summary statistics, but can also transform summary statistics that follow
a different distribution in approximately Poisson distributed statistics.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">create_jaatha_stat(name, calc_func, poisson = TRUE, breaks = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the summary statistic</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>calc_func</code></td>
<td>
<p>The function that summarizes the simulation data. Must take
two arguments. The first is the simulated data, and the second are
options that can be calculated from the real data. Ignoring the second 
argument in the function body should be fine in most situations. The 
function must return a numeric vector if <code>poisson = TRUE</code>, and can
also return a numeric matrix if <code>poisson = FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>poisson</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, it is assumed that the summary statistic
values are (at least approximately) independent and Poisson distributed.
If it is set to <code>FALSE</code>, the statistic is transformed into an approximately
Poisson distributed array using a binning approach. See "Transformation
of non Poisson distributed statistics" for details. If any summary
statistic is only approximately Poisson distributed, Jaatha is a
composite-likelihood method.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>breaks</code></td>
<td>
<p>The probabilities for the quantiles that are used for binning
the data. See the section on non Poisson distributed summary statistics
for details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The summary statistic. Indented for being used with
<code>create_jaatha_model</code>.
</p>


<h3>Transformation of non Poisson distributed statistics</h3>

<p>To transform a statistic into approximately Poisson distributed values,
we first calculate the empirical quantiles of the real data for the 
probabilities given in <code>breaks</code>. These are used as break points for
divining the range of the statistic into disjunct intervals. We then count
who many of the values for the simulated data fall into each intervals, and
use this counts as summary statistic. The counts are multinomial 
distributed, and should be close to the required Poisson distribution in 
most cases.
