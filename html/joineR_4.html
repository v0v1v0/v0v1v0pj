<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The joineR package implements methods for analyzing data from
longitudinal studies in which the response from each subject consists of a
time-sequence of repeated measurements and a possibly censored
time-to-event outcome. The modelling framework for the repeated
measurements is the linear model with random effects and/or correlated
error structure (Laird and Ware, 1982). The model for the time-to-event
outcome is a: Cox proportional hazards model with log-Gaussian frailty
(Cox, 1972). A cause-specific hazards model is used when competing risks
are present. Stochastic dependence is captured by allowing the Gaussian
random effects of the linear model to be correlated with the frailty term
of the Cox proportional hazards model. The methodology used to fit the
model is described in Henderson et al. (2002) in the case of a single event
time, and by Williamson et al. (2008) in the case of competing risks data.
Both models exploit the general methodology proposed by Wulfsohn and
Tsiatis (1997).
</p>
<p>The package offers several types of functions for the analysis of joint data.
</p>


<h3>Data manipulation functions</h3>

<p>There are several functions, including <code>jointdata</code>,
<code>sample.jointdata</code>, <code>subset.jointdata</code>, <code>to.balanced</code>,
<code>to.unbalanced</code>, and <code>UniqueVariables</code>, which offer the ability
to construct a joint model dataset and manipulate it, e.g. take a sample
according to a baseline covariate or outcome.
</p>


<h3>Plot functions</h3>

<p>The plot function can be applied to <code>jointdata</code> and <code>vargm</code>
(variogram) objects. In addition, <code>points</code> and <code>lines</code> can also
be used with <code>jointplot</code> objects.
</p>


<h3>Model fitting functions</h3>

<p>The primary function for fitting a joint model is <code>joint</code>. Standard
errors can be estimated using <code>jointSE</code>.
</p>
