<h2>Julia setup</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Julia must be installed separately in order for the <span class="pkg">JuliaConnectoR</span> package to work.
You can download and install Julia from <a href="https://julialang.org/downloads/">https://julialang.org/downloads/</a>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>



<h4>Setup via the Juliaup installation manager</h4>

<p>If you have installed Julia via Juliaup,
the Julia installation should be discovered by the <span class="pkg">JuliaConnectoR</span>.
</p>



<h4>Juliaup on Windows</h4>

<p>If you have freshly installed Juliaup, start Julia once on the command line.
This will do the actual installation of the current Julia version.
Juliaup puts the Julia executable on the system <span class="env">PATH</span>.
This way, the Julia installation can be detected by the <span class="pkg">JuliaConnectoR</span>.
</p>



<h4>Juliaup on Mac</h4>

<p>After the installation of Juliaup, Julia might not be on the system <span class="env">PATH</span>
but it should be discovered automatically
if it is installed in the default location, i.e., the <code>.juliaup</code>
folder in your home directory.
</p>



<h4>Setup via Julia binaries</h4>

<p>If you have installed Julia via a binary package or any other method,
the simplest way to make Julia discoverable is by adding the directory
containing the Julia executable to the <span class="env">PATH</span> environment variable.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can set the <span class="env">JULIA_BINDIR</span> environment variable
to specify the exact directory containing the Julia binary.
(You can find the correct path to this directory by evaluating the expression
<code>Sys.BINDIR</code> within Julia.)
</p>
<p>If the <span class="env">JULIA_BINDIR</span> variable is set, it takes precedence over
looking up the system <span class="env">PATH</span>.
This makes it easy to use a different Julia version
than the one in your system <span class="env">PATH</span>.
