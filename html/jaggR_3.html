<h2>Energy requirements for different activities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An experiment was conducted to compare the energy requirements of three
physical activities: running, walking and bicycle riding. Eight subjects were
asked to run, walk and bicycle a measured distance, and the number of
kilocalories expended per kilometre was measured for each subject during
each activity. The activities are run in random order with time for recovery
between activities. Each activity was monitored exactly once for each
individual.
