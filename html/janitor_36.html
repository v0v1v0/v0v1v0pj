<h2>janitor</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>janitor has simple little tools for examining and cleaning dirty data.
</p>


<h3>Main functions</h3>

<p>The main janitor functions can: perfectly format ugly <code>data.frame</code> column names; isolate
duplicate records for further study; and provide quick one- and two-variable tabulations
(i.e., frequency tables and crosstabs) that improve on the base R function <code>table()</code>.
</p>
<p>Other functions in the package can format for reporting the results of these tabulations.
These tabulate-and-report functions approximate popular features of SPSS and Microsoft Excel.
</p>


<h3>Package context</h3>

<p>This package follows the principles of the "tidyverse" and in particular works well with
the <code>%&gt;%</code> pipe function.
</p>
<p>janitor was built with beginning-to-intermediate R users in mind
and is optimized for user-friendliness.  Advanced users can already do everything
covered here, but they can do it faster with janitor and save their thinking for
more fun tasks.
