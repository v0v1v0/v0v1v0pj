<h2>
Provides functions for some small area estimators and their
mean squared errors.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> This package implements unit-level (Battese et al. 1988)
and area-level EBLUP (Fay and Herriot 1979), and GREG (Sarndal 1984)
estimators as well as their variance/MSE estimators. It also contains
data and a vignette that explain its use. Heteroscedasticity can
be considered. </p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The aim in the analysis of sample surveys is frequently to derive
estimates of subpopulation characteristics. Often, the sample available
for the subpopulation is, however, too small to allow a reliable
estimate. If an auxiliary variable exists that is correlated with the
variable of interest, small area estimation (SAE) provides methods to
solve the problem (Rao 2003, Rao and Molina 2015). 
</p>
<p>The purpose of this package is primarily to document the functions used
in the publications Breidenbach and Astrup (2012) and Breidenbach et
al. (2018). The data used in Breidenbach and Astrup (2012) are provided.
A subset of the data used in Breidenbach et al. (2018) is also provided
for testing the functions. The vignette further documents the
publication Breidenbach et al. (2015).
</p>
<p>You might wonder why this package is called JoSAE. Well, first of all,
JoSAE sounds good (if pronounced like the female name). The other reason
was that the packages SAE and SAE2 already exist (Gomez-Rubio,
2008). They are, however, not available on CRAN and unmaintained (as of
July 2011). They also do not seem to implement the variance estimators
that we needed. So I just combined SAE with the first part of my name.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>All the implemented functions/estimators are described in Rao (2003). This
package merely makes the use of the estimators easier for the users
that are not keen on programming. Especially the EBLUP variance
estimator would require some effort.
</p>
<p>Today, there are several well programmed SAE packages available on
CRAN that also provide the functions described here. This was not the
case when the first version of the package was uploaded. This package
is therefore mostly to document the publications mentioned above. With
respect to heteroskedasticity, this package also implements functions
that, as far as I can see, are not available in other packages (as of
May 2018).
