<h2>Cattle Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Kenward (1987) reported an experiment in which cattle were assigned randomly
to two treatment groups A and B, and their body weights were recorded in
kilogram. Thirty animals received treatment A and another 30 received
treatment B. The animals were weighted 11 times over a 133-day period; the
first 10 measurements for each animal were made at two-week intervals and the
last measurement was made one week later. Since no observation was missing,
it is considered to be a balanced longitudinal dataset.
